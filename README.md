## Hello, I'm Juliane.

I'm a software engineer and a teaching assistant. My work has taken me from database administration to FinTech to website design to fullstack software engineering.

Check out my [website](https://julianecassidy.com) and follow along with my learning on my [blog](https://julianecassidy.com/blog). Like many of my projects on this journey, they are extremely over-engineered.

My current projects include:

- [julianecassidy/randomrhythms](https://github.com/julianecassidy/randomrhythms-api)
- [julianecassidy/fetch-folio](https://github.com/julianecassidy/fetch-folio)

Some of my previous projects include:

- [julianecassidy/react-jobify](https://github.com/julianecassidy/react-jobify)
- [julianecassidy/flitter](https://github.com/julianecassidy/flitter)
